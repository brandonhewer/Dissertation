### A System for Exploring the Relationship Between Dinaturality and Parametric Polymorphism

#### University of Bath BSc Computer Science Dissertation by Brandon Hewer

Polymorphism, a ubiquitous concept throughout computer science, describes the application of a single operation to a set of possible data types. In his 1967 lecture titled ‘Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages’, Strachey (2000) introduced the contrasting ideas of ad-hoc and parametric polymorphism.

Dinatural transformations have been investigated as a formal model for parametric polymorphism. Bainbridge, Freyd, Scedrov and Scott (1990) introduce a formal model of parametric polymorphism in which the parametricity property is described by naturality conditions. 

In their paper, ‘On Compositionality of Dinatural Transformations’, McCusker and Santamaria (2018) make use of Petri net models in order to establish conditions under which the composition of dinatural transformations preserves dinaturality.

This dissertation explores the relationship between parametric polymorphism and the categorical notion of dinaturality. In addition, a system designed to explore this connection is introduced, along with associated results and contributions.
