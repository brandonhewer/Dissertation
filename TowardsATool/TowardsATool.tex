\section{Towards a Computational Tool}
\subsection{A brief reflection}
The construction of programs, to solve complex problems, is central to the field of computer science. Although there does not exist any known single solution to every computational problem, an abundance of general problem-solving techniques have been devised. Perhaps the most ubiquitous of these techniques, is the approach of decomposing a problem into smaller pieces.
