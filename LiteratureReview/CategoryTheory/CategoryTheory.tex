\subsection{A formal approach to structure}
Category theory is a branch of mathematics concerned with the formalisation of structure. A category is a mathematical object consisting of two components: objects and morphisms. Objects represent `nodes' within a category, while morphisms are directed arrows with a domain and co-domain object. The set of objects in a category $\mathbb{C}$ will henceforth be denoted as $ob(\mathbb{C})$ while the set of morphisms will be denoted as $hom(\mathbb{C})$. The set of morphisms between two objects $X, Y \in ob(\mathbb{C})$ will be denoted $hom(X, Y)$. Two morphisms $f : X \rightarrow Y$ and $g : Y \rightarrow Z$ may be composed to create a new morphism $g \circ f$. Composition of morphisms is an associative operation:
\begin{equation}
  \forall f, g, h \in hom(\mathbb{C})\ |\ h \circ (g \circ f) = (h \circ g) \circ f.
\end{equation}
Every object has an associated identity morphism:
\begin{equation}
  \forall X,\ Y \in
  ob(\mathbb{C})\ \forall f : X \rightarrow Y \in hom(\mathbb{C})\ |\ f \circ id_{X} = id_{Y} \circ f.
\end{equation}
Directed graphs are often used to represent categories. A category $\mathbb{C}$ with objects $ob(\mathbb{C}) = \{X, Y\}$ and morphisms $f : X \rightarrow Y$, $g : Y \rightarrow X$, may be represented by the following diagram:
\begin{equation}\label{category}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline= (a).base]
    \node[scale=1.2] (a) at (0,0) {
      \begin{tikzcd}
        X \arrow[r, bend right=40, "f"{below}]
        \arrow[loop left, "id_{X}"]
        &  Y \arrow[l, bend right=40, "g"{above}]
        \arrow[loop right, "id_{Y}"]
      \end{tikzcd}.
    };
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation}
The diagram presented in \eqref{category} depicts two objects connected in a directed cyclic graph. The required identity morphism has been included for each object.
\par
A prominent example of a category, which is of particular interest to functional programmers, is the category of types and functions in the Haskell programming language. This category is termed \lstinline{Hask}, and its objects are given by types in Haskell. Morphisms from \lstinline{X} to \lstinline{Y} are given by functions of the type \lstinline{X -> Y}. The identity morphism on a type \lstinline{X} is given by the function \lstinline{id :: X -> X}. Composition is given by the \lstinline{(.)} function.

\subsection{Product and opposite categories}
Given two categories $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{D}$, their product, denoted $\mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{D}$, is the category whose objects are pairs of the form $(X, Y)$, $X \in ob(\mathbb{C})$, $Y \in ob(\mathbb{D})$. For all pairs of morphisms 
\begin{flalign}
f : X \rightarrow X' \in hom(\mathbb{C}),\ g : Y \rightarrow Y' \in hom(\mathbb{D}),
\end{flalign}
there exists a morphism 
\begin{flalign}
(f, g) : (X, Y) \rightarrow (X', Y') \in hom(\mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{D}).
\end{flalign}
Given morphisms $f : X \rightarrow Y$, $f' : Y \rightarrow Z \in hom(\mathbb{C})$ and $g : X' \rightarrow Y'$, $g' : Y' \rightarrow Z' \in hom(\mathbb{D})$, composition of morphisms $(f, g)$, $(f',g') \in hom(\mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{D})$ is given by
\begin{flalign}
  (f', g') \circ (f, g) = (f' \circ f, g' \circ g).
\end{flalign}
The identity morphism on an object $(X, Y) \in ob(\mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{D})$ is given by
\begin{flalign}
  id_{(X,Y)} = (id_X, id_Y).
\end{flalign}
The product of two categories is also known as a product category. Another ubiquitous operation performed on categories is the reversal of morphisms, to form an opposite category. Formally, given a category $\mathbb{C}$ the opposite category, denoted $\mathbb{C}^{op}$, is the category given by
\begin{flalign}
  ob(\mathbb{C}^{op}) &= ob(\mathbb{C}),\\
  hom_{\mathbb{C}^{op}}(X, Y) &= hom_{\mathbb{C}}(Y, X),\\
  id_X \in hom(\mathbb{C}) &= id_X \in hom(\mathbb{C}^{op}),\\
  \forall f : X \rightarrow Y,\ g : Y \rightarrow Z \in \mathbb{C}^{op}\ &|\ g \circ_{\mathbb{C}^{op}} f = f \circ_{\mathbb{C}} g.
\end{flalign} 

\subsection{Structure-preserving maps}\label{section:functor}
In category theory, a functor is a map between categories which preserves identity and composition. Formally, a functor $F : \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{D}$ is defined as associating to each object $X$ in $\mathbb{C}$ an object $F (X)$ in $\mathbb{D}$ and to each morphism $f : X \rightarrow Y$ in $\mathbb{C}$ a morphism $F(f) : F(X) \rightarrow F(Y)$ in $\mathbb{D}$. Given the functor $F$, the following conditions must hold:
\begin{flalign}\label{functor-def}
  F (id_{X}) &= id_{F (X)},\\
  \forall f : X \rightarrow Y, g : Y \rightarrow Z &\in \mathbb{C} : F (g \circ f) = F (g) \circ F (f).
\end{flalign}
An example of a functor, provided within the Haskell programming language, is the list functor, as shown in \lstref{Haskell-List}.
\begin{lstlisting}[
  caption={An instantiation of the list functor in Haskell},
  label={Haskell-List}
]
instance Functor [] where
  fmap f []     = []
  fmap f (x:xs) = f x : (fmap f xs)
\end{lstlisting}
In the provided example \lstinline{[]} is known as a type constructor or higher-kinded type. A type constructor is a function which operates on types. The list functor, \lstinline{[] : Hask -> Hask}, where \lstinline{Hask} is the category of Haskell types, maps any type \lstinline{a} to a type \lstinline{[a]}. Morphisms of the type \lstinline{f : a -> b} are lifted to \lstinline{[a] -> [b]} by defining a function which applies \lstinline{f} to every element in a list. A correct implementation of \lstinline{fmap} must satisfy the functorial laws outlined in (32) and (33). A functor whose co-domain category is the same as its domain, such as \lstinline{[]}, is termed an endo-functor.

The definition of a functor generalises to the notion of a multifunctor. A multifunctor is a functor of the form $\mathbb{C}_1 \times \mathbb{C}_2 \times \cdots \times \mathbb{C}_n \rightarrow \mathbb{D}$, i.e., a functor whose domain is a product category. An example of a multifunctor is given by the product bifunctor in the Haskell programming language, as shown in Listing \ref{Haskell-Product}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
  caption={An instantiation of the product bifunctor in Haskell},
  label={Haskell-Product}
]
instance Bifunctor (,) where
  bimap f g (x, y) = (f x, g y)
\end{lstlisting}
In the given formulation, if there exists $\mathbb{C}_i, \mathbb{C}_j$, such that $\mathbb{C}_i^{op} = \mathbb{C}_j$, the multifunctor is said to be of mixed variance. An important example of a multifunctor is the hom-functor of a category $\mathbb{C}$, which is of the form $\mathbb{C}^{op} \times \mathbb{C} \rightarrow Set$, and is a functor from pairs of objects in $\mathbb{C}$ to their hom-sets in $Set$. An example of a hom-functor is given by the arrow profunctor in the Haskell programming language, as depicted in Listing \ref{Haskell-Arrow}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
  caption={An instantiation of the arrow profunctor in Haskell},
  label={Haskell-Arrow}
]
instance Profunctor (->) where
  dimap f h g = h . g . f
\end{lstlisting}

Observe that, in the functional programming language Haskell, the notion of a functor translates to a restricted set of type constructors. The type constructors in question are those for which it is possible to define the function \lstinline{fmap}, such that the functorial laws are satisfied. 

\subsection{Natural transformations}
A natural transformation is a family of morphisms which collectively describe a structure-preserving map between two functors. The structure-preserving condition of a natural transformation $\eta_{X} : F(X) \rightarrow G(X)$ between two functors $F, G : \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{D}$, is expressed by the following commutative diagram:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:naturality}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline= (a).base]
    \node[scale=1.2] (a) at (0,0) {
      \begin{tikzcd}
        F (X) \arrow[r, "F (f)"] \arrow[d, "\eta_{X}"']
        &  F (Y) \arrow[d, "\eta_{Y}"]
        \\ G (X) \arrow[r, "G (f)"]
        &  G (Y)
      \end{tikzcd}.
    };
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation}

An intuitive understanding of naturality, from a functional programming perspective, may be acquired by observing the properties of an example natural transformation. Such an example, in Haskell, is the parametrically polymorphic \lstinline{safeHead} function.
\begin{lstlisting}[
  breaklines,
  breakatwhitespace,
  caption={An implementation of \lstinline{safeHead} in Haskell},
  label={Haskell-SafeHead}
]
safeHead :: [a] -> Maybe a
safeHead []     = Nothing
safeHead (x:_)  = Just x
\end{lstlisting}

Listing \ref{Haskell-SafeHead} depicts an implementation of the \lstinline{safeHead} natural transformation from the \lstinline{List} functor to the \lstinline{Maybe} functor. It is evident that \lstinline{safeHead} exhibits the naturality condition; given any function \lstinline{f : a -> b} the following equality holds:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c}
\begin{lstlisting}
fmap f . safeHead = safeHead . fmap f.
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The discerning reader may  recognise this as the free theorem for \lstinline{safeHead}. This is an indication of a deeper relationship between naturality conditions and parametricity. Indeed, determining the nature of this relationship is the leading motivation of the work outlined in this paper.
\par
The formulation of naturality depicted in \eqref{eq:naturality} does not encapsulate transformations between mixed-variance functors. As described in Section \ref{section:functor}, mixed variance may be found in functors whose domain or co-domain is a product category, such as any hom-functor $Hom_{\mathbb{C}} : \mathbb{C}^{op} \times \mathbb{C} \rightarrow Set$, where $\mathbb{C}^{op}$ is the opposite category of $\mathbb{C}$. \citeasnoun{GeneralTransform} advanced a more general conception of naturality, known as extranaturality, to account for transformations between mixed-variance functors. The structure-preserving condition of an extranatural transformation $\alpha_{X,Z} : F(X,X) \rightarrow G(Z,Z)$ between two functors $F : \mathbb{C}^{op} \times \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{D}$ and $G : \mathbb{B}^{op} \times \mathbb{B} \rightarrow \mathbb{D}$, is expressed by the following commutative diagram:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:extranaturality}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline= (a).base]
    \node[scale=1.2] (a) at (0,0) {
      \begin{tikzcd}
        F (X', X) \arrow[r, "{F (id, f)}"] \arrow[d, "{F (f, id)}"']
        &  F (X', X') \arrow[d, "\alpha_{X', Z}"]
        \\ F (X, X) \arrow[r, "\alpha_{X, Z}"]
        &  G (Z, Z)
      \end{tikzcd}.
    };
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation}
In this formulation of naturality, the transformation $\alpha$ is said to be extranatural in X, providing Z does not depend on X. An example of an extranatural transformation is the parametrically polymorphic evaluation map.
\begin{lstlisting}[
  breaklines,
  breakatwhitespace,
  caption={An implementation of an evaluation map function in Haskell},
  label={Haskell-Eval}
]
eval :: (a -> b, a) -> b
eval (f, x) = f x
\end{lstlisting}
\lstref{Haskell-Eval} depicts an implementation of the evaluation map, which is extranatural in the type variable \lstinline{a}. By observation, the extranaturality condition can be verified; given any function \lstinline{f : a -> b}, the following equality holds:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c}
\begin{lstlisting}
eval . bimap id f = eval . bimap (. f) id.
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
As might be expected, this is the free theorem for the \lstinline{eval} function. Thus, it can be observed that the relationship between naturality and parametricity extends to extranaturality.
\par
The extranaturality condition does not extend to transformations in which mixed variance is present in both the domain and co-domain. A more general notion of naturality is required to describe such a family of morphisms; dinaturality. Given two functors $F, G : \mathbb{C}^{op} \times \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{D}$, the structure-preserving condition of a dinatural transformation $\phi : F \rightarrow G$ is described by the following commutative diagram:
\begin{equation}\label{dinaturality}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline= (a).base]
    \node[scale=1.2] (a) at (0,0) {
      \begin{tikzcd}
        &  F (X, X) \arrow[r, "\phi_{X}"]
        &  G (X, X) \arrow[dr, "{G (id, f)}"]
        &
        \\ F (X', X) \arrow[ur, "{F (f, id)}"] \arrow[dr, swap, "{F (id, f)}"]
        &
        &
        &  G (X, X')
        \\
        &  F (X', X') \arrow[r, swap, "\phi_{X'}"]
        &  G (X', X') \arrow[ur, swap, "{G (f, id)}"]
        &
      \end{tikzcd}.
    };
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation}
Examples of dinatural transformations include the Y-combinator $Y : (A \rightarrow A) \rightarrow A$ and the Church-numeral encoding e.g., $N_{1} : (A \rightarrow A) \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A)$. An example of the dinatural transformation, fix, in the Haskell programming language, is given in Listing \ref{Haskell-Y}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
  breaklines,
  breakatwhitespace,
  caption={An implementation of the fix function (Y-Combinator) in Haskell},
  label={Haskell-Y}
]
fix :: (a -> a) -> a
fix f = let x = f x in x
\end{lstlisting}
By observation, the dinaturality condition for the fix function can be verified; given functions \lstinline{f : b -> a} and \lstinline{g : a -> b}, the following equality holds:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c}
\begin{lstlisting}
fix (g . f) = g (fix (f . g)).
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
This equality is the free theorem on \lstinline{fix}. As such, it appears that the relationship between naturality and parametricity extends to dinaturality.
\par 
In Reynold's formulation of parametricity, the composition of two parametrically polymorphic functions preserves parametricity. Accordingly, it is appropriate to investigate whether composition of natural transformations preserves naturality.

\subsection{Natural composition}\label{sec:naturalcomp}
The vertical composition of two natural transformations $\eta_X : F(X) \rightarrow G(X)$ and $\gamma_X : G(X) \rightarrow H(X)$, is defined as $(\gamma \bullet \eta)_X = \gamma_X \circ \eta_X$. Vertical composition can also be depicted by the following commutative diagram:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nat_vertical}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline= (a).base]
    \node[scale=1.2] (a) at (0,0) {
      \begin{tikzcd}
        F (X) \arrow[r, "F (f)"] \arrow[d, "\eta_{X}"']
        &  F (Y) \arrow[d, "\eta_{Y}"]
        \\ G (X) \arrow[r, "G (f)"] \arrow[d, "\gamma_{X}"']
        &  G (Y) \arrow[d, "\gamma_{Y}"]
        \\ H (X) \arrow[r, "H (f)"]
        &  H (Y)
      \end{tikzcd}.
    };
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation}
Given two natural transformations $\alpha_X : F(X) \rightarrow G(X)$ and $\beta_X : H(X) \rightarrow K(X)$, with functors $F, G : \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{D}$ and $H, K : \mathbb{D} \rightarrow \mathbb{E}$, their horizontal composition is defined as $(\beta * \alpha)_X = K (\alpha_X) \circ \beta_{F(X)}$. Horizontal composition may also be depicted by the following commutative diagram:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nat_vertical}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline= (a).base]
    \node[scale=1.2] (a) at (0,0) {
      \begin{tikzcd}
        \mathbb{C}
        \arrow[r, bend left=60, "F"{name=F, above}]
        \arrow[r, swap, bend right=60, "G"{name=G, below}]
        \arrow[r, Rightarrow, from=F, to=G, shorten <= 2.6pt, shorten >= 2.6pt, "\alpha"{}]
        &
        \mathbb{D}
        \arrow[r, bend left=60, "H"{name=H, above}]
        \arrow[r, swap, bend right=60, "K"{name=K, below}]
        \arrow[r, Rightarrow, from=H, to=K, shorten <= 2.6pt, shorten >= 2.6pt, "\beta"{}]
        &
        \mathbb{E}
      \end{tikzcd}.
    };
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation}
\\
Vertical and horizontal composition of natural transformations are related by the interchange law. The interchange law states that given natural transformations $\alpha$, $\alpha'$, $\beta$, $\beta'$ there is an equality $(\beta' * \alpha') \bullet (\beta * \alpha) = (\beta' \bullet \beta) * (\alpha' \bullet \alpha)$. The interchange law can intuitively be understood by observing the equality of composing commutative diagrams:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nat_vertical}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline= (a).base]
    \node[scale=1.2] (a) at (0,0) {
      \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=tiny]

        &
        \mathbb{E}
      \end{tikzcd}
      =

        &
        \mathbb{D}

        &
        \mathbb{E}
      \end{tikzcd}.
    };
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation}
\\
The notion of vertical and horizontal composition, and the associated interchange law, extends to the more general notion of 2-cells in any strict 2-category. In the given examples, the strict 2-category is the category $Cat$. In $Cat$, objects, known as 0-cells, are locally small categories. Morphisms  in $Cat$ are functor categories, in which objects (1-cells) are functors and morphisms (2-cells) are natural transformations.

Following from the well-defined notion of composition of natural transformations, it is reasonable to pursue a similar formulation in the generalised dinatural case. Unfortunately, such a pursuit leads to a notorious problem; in general, dinatural transformations do not compose. This is in contrast to the composability of parametrically polymorphic functions. Formally, given functors $F,\ G,\ H : \mathbb{C}^{op} \times \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{D}$ and dinatural transformations $\phi : F \rightarrow G$,  $\psi : G \rightarrow H$, it is not necessarily true that the outer hexagon in the following diagram commutes:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dicompose}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline= (a).base]
    \node[scale=1] (a) at (0,0) {
      \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=small]
        &  F (X, X)  \arrow[r, "\phi_{X}"]
        &  G (X, X)  \arrow[dr, swap, "{G (id, f)}"] \arrow[r, "\psi_{X}"]
        &  H (X, X)  \arrow[dr, "{H (id, f)}"]
        &
        \\ F (X', X) \arrow[ur, "{F (f, id)}"] \arrow[dr, swap, "{F (id, f)}"]
        &  G (X', X) \arrow[ur, swap, "{G (f, id)}"] \arrow[dr, "{G (id, f)}"]
        &
        &  G (X, X')
        &  H (X, X')
        \\
        &  F (X', X') \arrow[r, swap, "\phi_{X'}"]
        &  G (X', X') \arrow[ur, "{G (f, id)}"] \arrow[r, swap, "\psi_{X'}"]
        &  H (X', X') \arrow[ur, swap, "{H (f, id)}"]
        &
      \end{tikzcd}.
    };
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation}
\\
To prove that this is indeed the case, a counterexample is presented, described by \citeasnoun{FunctorialPolymorphism}. Define three endofunctors, in the category $Set$,
\begin{flalign}\label{func-def}
  Hom : Set^{op} \times Set \rightarrow Set,\ 
  K_{BOOL} : Set^{op} \times Set \rightarrow Set,\ 
  K_{1} : Set \rightarrow Set,
\end{flalign}
where $Hom$ is the hom-functor, and $K_{BOOL}$, $K_1$ are constant functors which map into $\{0, 1\}$ and the one-element set, respectively. Consider the two dinatural transformations 
\begin{flalign}\label{nat-def}
  \psi : K_1 \rightarrow Hom,\ \phi : Hom \rightarrow K_{BOOL},
\end{flalign}
where $\psi_X$ always maps to the identity on $X$, and $\phi_X$ is defined as follows:
\begin{flalign}\label{nat-def}
  \phi_X (f) = 
  \begin{cases}
    0 & \text{if number of fixed points of } \textit{f} \text{ is even or not finite}\\
    1 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}.
\end{flalign}
If the composition of $\phi$ and $\psi$ is dinatural, the resulting family of morphisms should satisfy the condition described by the commuting hexagon depicted in (\ref{eq:dinaturality}). It is clear that the family of morphisms $(\phi \cdot \psi)_X : K_1(X) \rightarrow K_{BOOL}(X)$ is a map between constant functors, and therefore, to be dinatural, must only describe a single morphism. However, the family of morphisms $(\phi \cdot \psi)_X$ is dependant on $X$, and describes two morphisms; one for each of the two possible parities of the number of fixpoints.
\par
In the circumstance in which the centre diamond found in (\ref{eq:dicompose}) is a pullback, the outer hexagon commutes, and the composition is dinatural. Formally, this diamond is a pullback if for all objects $Y \in \mathbb{D}$ and morphisms $f : Y \rightarrow G(X, X)$, $g : Y \rightarrow G(X', X')$, there exists a unique morphism $h : Y \rightarrow G(X', X)$, such that the following diagram commutes:

As demonstrated, for the purposes of capturing the uniformity property of parametrically polymorphic types, the notion of dinaturality is too weak. Attempts to resolve this dilemma involve introducing additional constraints, in order to identify a class of dinatural transformations which compose. In the search for a unifying notion of uniformity, existing formulations of a categorical semantics for parametricity will be explored.
